# git-pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch

## SYNOPSIS

    git pull [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]

## DESCRIPTION

Integrate changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

First, **git** **pull** runs **git** **fetch** with the same arguments
(excluding merge options) to fetch remote branch(es). Then it decides
which remote branch to integrate: if you run **git** **pull** with no
arguments this defaults to the upstream for the current branch. Then it
integrates that branch into the current branch.

There are 4 main options for integrating the remote branch:

> 1\.
>
> **git** **pull** **--ff-only** will only do "fast-forward" updates: it
> fails if your local branch has diverged from the remote branch. This
> is the default.

> 2\.
>
> **git** **pull** **--rebase** runs **git** **rebase**

> 3\.
>
> **git** **pull** **--no-rebase** runs **git** **merge**.

> 4\.
>
> **git** **pull** **--squash** runs **git** **merge** **--squash**

You can also set the configuration options **pull.rebase**,
**pull.squash**, or **pull.ff** with your preferred behaviour.

If there’s a merge conflict during the merge or rebase that you don’t
want to handle, you can safely abort it with **git** **merge**
**--abort** or **git** **rebase** **--abort**.

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Supported? |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| *\<repository\>* | The "remote" repository to pull from. This can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below). | ✅ |
| *\<refspec\>* | Which branch or other reference(s) to fetch and integrate into the current branch, for example **main** in **git** **pull** **origin** **main**. Defaults to the configured upstream for the current branch. | ✅ |
| **-q**, **--quiet** | This is passed to both underlying git-fetch to squelch reporting of during transfer, and underlying git-merge to squelch output during merging. | ❌ |
| **-v**, **--verbose** | Pass **--verbose** to git-fetch and git-merge. | ❌ |
| **--recurse-submodules**\[**=**(**yes**\\|**on-demand**\\|**no**)\], |  | ❌ |
| **--no-recurse-submodules** | This option controls if new commits of populated submodules should be fetched, and if the working trees of active submodules should be updated, too (see **git-fetch**(1), **git-config**(1) and **gitmodules**(5)). | ❌ |
| **--commit**, **--no-commit** | Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override **--no-commit**. Only useful when merging. | ❌ |
| **--edit**, **-e**, **--no-edit** | Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can explain and justify the merge. The **--no-edit** option can be used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). | ❌ |
| **--cleanup=***\<mode\>* | This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before committing. See **git-commit**(1) for more details. In addition, if the *\<mode\>* is given a value of **scissors**, scissors will be appended to **MERGE_MSG** before being passed on to the commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict. | ❌ |
| **--ff-only** | Only update to the new history if there is no divergent local history. This is the default when no method for reconciling divergent histories is provided (via the **--rebase** flags). | ❌ |
| **--ff**, **--no-ff** | When merging rather than rebasing, specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is already a descendant of the current history. If merging is requested, **--ff** is the default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not stored in its natural place in the **refs/tags/** hierarchy, in which case **--no-ff** is assumed. | ❌ |
| **-S**\[*\<key-id\>*\], **--gpg-sign**\[**=***\<key-id\>*\], |  | ❌ |
| **--no-gpg-sign** | GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The *\<key-id\>* argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space. **--no-gpg-sign** is useful to countermand both **commit.gpgSign** configuration variable, and earlier **--gpg-sign**. | ❌ |
| **--log**\[**=***\<n\>*\], **--no-log** | In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line descriptions from at most *\<n\>* actual commits that are being merged. See also **git-fmt-merge-msg**(1). Only useful when merging. | ❌ |
| **--signoff**, **--no-signoff** | Add a **Signed-off-by** trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you’re committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project’s license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin. (See **https://developercertificate.org** for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you’re contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project. | ❌ |
| **--stat**, **-n**, **--no-stat** | Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat. | ❌ |
| **--compact-summary** | Show a compact-summary at the end of the merge. | ❌ |
| **--squash**, **--no-squash** | Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit, move the **HEAD**, or record **\$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD** (to cause the next **git** **commit** command to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus). | ❌ |
| **--verify**, **--no-verify** | By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run. When **--no-verify** is given, these are bypassed. See also **githooks**(5). Only useful when merging. | ❌ |
| **-s** *\<strategy\>*, **--strategy=***\<strategy\>* | Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no **-s** option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (**ort** when merging a single head, **octopus** otherwise). | ❌ |
| **-X** *\<option\>*, **--strategy-option=***\<option\>* | Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy. | ❌ |
| **--verify-signatures**, **--no-verify-signatures** | Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the merge is aborted. | ❌ |
| **--summary**, **--no-summary** | Synonyms to **--stat** and **--no-stat**; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future. | ❌ |
| **--autostash**, **--no-autostash** | Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation begins, record it in the ref **MERGE_AUTOSTASH** and apply it after the operation ends. This means that you can run the operation on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application after a successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts. | ❌ |
| **--allow-unrelated-histories** | By default, **git** **merge** command refuses to merge histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable this by default exists or will be added. | ❌ |
| **-r**, |  | ❌ |
| **--rebase**\[**=**(**true**\\|**merges**\\|**false**\\|**interactive**)\] | **true** | ❌ |
| **--no-rebase** | This is shorthand for **--rebase=false**. ## Options related to fetching | ❌ |
| **--all**, **--no-all** | Fetch all remotes, except for the ones that has the **remote.***\<name\>***.skipFetchAll** configuration variable set. This overrides the configuration variable **fetch.all**. | ❌ |
| **-a**, **--append** | Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of **.git/FETCH_HEAD**. Without this option old data in **.git/FETCH_HEAD** will be overwritten. | ❌ |
| **--atomic** | Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated. | ❌ |
| **--depth=***\<depth\>* | Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a *shallow* repository created by **git** **clone** with **--depth=***\<depth\>* option (see **git-clone**(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched. | ❌ |
| **--deepen=***\<depth\>* | Similar to **--depth**, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch history. | ❌ |
| **--shallow-since=***\<date\>* | Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after *\<date\>*. | ❌ |
| **--shallow-exclude=***\<ref\>* | Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option can be specified multiple times. | ❌ |
| **--unshallow** | If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow repositories. | ❌ |
| **--update-shallow** | By default when fetching from a shallow repository, **git** **fetch** refuses refs that require updating **.git/shallow**. This option updates **.git/shallow** and accepts such refs. | ❌ |
| **--negotiation-tip=**(*\<commit\>*\\|*\<glob\>*) | By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched. | ❌ |
| **--negotiate-only** | Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided **--negotiation-tip=** arguments, which we have in common with the server. | ❌ |
| **--dry-run** | Show what would be done, without making any changes. | ❌ |
| **--porcelain** | Print the output to standard output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. See section OUTPUT in **git-fetch**(1) for details. | ❌ |
| **-f**, **--force** | When **git** **fetch** is used with *\<src\>***:***\<dst\>* refspec, it may refuse to update the local branch as discussed in the *\<refspec\>* part of the **git-fetch**(1) documentation. This option overrides that check. | ❌ |
| **-k**, **--keep** | Keep downloaded pack. | ❌ |
| **--prefetch** | Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the **refs/prefetch/** namespace. See the **prefetch** task in **git-maintenance**(1). | ❌ |
| **-p**, **--prune** | Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a **--tags** option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the **--mirror** option), then they are also subject to pruning. Supplying **--prune-tags** is a shorthand for providing the tag refspec. | ❌ |
| **--no-tags** | By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option disables this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the **remote.***\<name\>***.tagOpt** setting. See **git-config**(1). | ❌ |
| **--refmap=***\<refspec\>* | When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote-tracking branches, instead of the values of **remote.***\<name\>***.fetch** configuration variables for the remote repository. Providing an empty *\<refspec\>* to the **--refmap** option causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command-line arguments. See section on "Configured Remote-tracking Branches" for details. | ❌ |
| **-t**, **--tags** | Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags **refs/tags/\*** into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if **--prune** is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see **--prune**). | ❌ |
| **-j** *\<n\>*, **--jobs=***\<n\>* | Parallelize all forms of fetching up to *\<n\>* jobs at a time. | ❌ |
| **--set-upstream** | If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less **git-pull**(1) and other commands. For more information, see **branch.***\<name\>***.merge** and **branch.***\<name\>***.remote** in **git-config**(1). | ❌ |
| **--upload-pack** *\<upload-pack\>* | When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by **git** **fetch-pack**, **--exec=***\<upload-pack\>* is passed to the command to specify non-default path for the command run on the other end. | ❌ |
| **--progress** | Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless **-q** is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal. | ❌ |
| **-o** *\<option\>*, **--server-option=***\<option\>* | Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a *NUL* or *LF* character. The server’s handling of server options, including unknown ones, is server-specific. When multiple **--server-option=***\<option\>* are given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line. When no **--server-option=***\<option\>* is given from the command line, the values of configuration variable **remote.***\<name\>***.serverOption** are used instead. | ❌ |
| **--show-forced-updates** | By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. This can be disabled through **fetch.showForcedUpdates**, but the **--show-forced-updates** option guarantees this check occurs. See **git-config**(1). | ❌ |
| **--no-show-forced-updates** | By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. Pass **--no-show-forced-updates** or set **fetch.showForcedUpdates** to false to skip this check for performance reasons. If used during **git-pull** the **--ff-only** option will still check for forced updates before attempting a fast-forward update. See **git-config**(1). | ❌ |
| **-4**, **--ipv4** | Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses. | ❌ |
| **-6**, **--ipv6** | Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses. | ❌ |
| *\<repository\>* | The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below). | ✅ |
| *\<refspec\>* | Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no *\<refspec\>*s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read from **remote.***\<repository\>***.fetch** variables instead (see the section "CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES" in **git-fetch**(1)). | ✅ |

## GIT URLS

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and
ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
do not use them).

The native transport (i.e. **git://** URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

> ·
>
> **ssh://**\[*\<user\>***@**\]*\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

> ·
>
> **git://***\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

> ·
>
> **http**\[**s**\]**://***\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

> ·
>
> **ftp**\[**s**\]**://***\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

> ·
>
> \[*\<user\>***@**\]*\<host\>***:/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first
colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For
example the local path **foo:bar** could be specified as an absolute
path or **./foo:bar** to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support **~***\<username\>*
expansion:

> ·
>
> **ssh://**\[*\<user\>***@**\]*\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/~***\<user\>***/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

> ·
>
> **git://***\<host\>*\[**:***\<port\>*\]**/~***\<user\>***/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

> ·
>
> \[*\<user\>***@**\]*\<host\>***:~***\<user\>***/***\<path-to-git-repo\>*

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:

> ·
>
> **/path/to/repo.git/**

> ·
>
> **file:///path/to/repo.git/**

These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
former implies **--local** option. See **git-clone**(1) for details.

**git** **clone**, **git** **fetch** and **git** **pull**, but not
**git** **push**, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See
**git-bundle**(1).

When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the **remote-***\<transport\>* remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may
be used:

> ·
>
> *\<transport\>***::***\<address\>*

where *\<address\>* may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
See **gitremote-helpers**(7) for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
section of the form:

>         [url "<actual-url-base>"]
>                     insteadOf = <other-url-base>

For example, with this:

>         [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
>                     insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
>                     insteadOf = work:

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
"git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:

>         [url "<actual-url-base>"]
>                     pushInsteadOf = <other-url-base>

For example, with this:

>         [url "ssh://example.org/"]
>                     pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.

## REMOTES

The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
*\<repository\>* argument:

> ·
>
> a remote in the Git configuration file: **\$GIT_DIR/config**,

> ·
>
> a file in the **\$GIT_DIR/remotes** directory, or

> ·
>
> a file in the **\$GIT_DIR/branches** directory.

All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

### Named remote in configuration file

You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using **git-remote**(1), **git-config**(1) or even by a
manual edit to the **\$GIT_DIR/config** file. The URL of this remote
will be used to access the repository. The refspec of this remote will
be used by default when you do not provide a refspec on the command
line. The entry in the config file would appear like this:

>         [remote "<name>"]
>                     url = <URL>
>                     pushurl = <pushurl>
>                     push = <refspec>
>                     fetch = <refspec>

The *\<pushurl\>* is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults
to *\<URL\>*. Pushing to a remote affects all defined pushurls or all
defined urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch, however, will only fetch
from the first defined url if multiple urls are defined.

### Named file in **\$GIT_DIR/remotes**

You can choose to provide the name of a file in **\$GIT_DIR/remotes**.
The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec
in this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec
on the command line. This file should have the following format:

>         URL: one of the above URL formats
>             Push: <refspec>
>             Pull: <refspec>

**Push:** lines are used by **git** **push** and **Pull:** lines are
used by **git** **pull** and **git** **fetch**. Multiple **Push:** and
**Pull:** lines may be specified for additional branch mappings.

### Named file in **\$GIT_DIR/branches**

You can choose to provide the name of a file in **\$GIT_DIR/branches**.
The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file
should have the following format:

>         <URL>#<head>

*\<URL\>* is required; \#*\<head\>* is optional.

Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs,
if you don’t provide one on the command line. *\<branch\>* is the name
of this file in **\$GIT_DIR/branches** and *\<head\>* defaults to
**master**.

git fetch uses:

>         refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>

git push uses:

>         HEAD:refs/heads/<head>

## UPSTREAM BRANCHES

Branches in Git can optionally have an upstream remote branch. Git
defaults to using the upstream branch for remote operations, for
example:

> ·
>
> It’s the default for **git** **pull** or **git** **fetch** with no
> arguments.

> ·
>
> It’s the default for **git** **push** with no arguments, with some
> exceptions. For example, you can use the
> **branch.***\<name\>***.pushRemote** option to push to a different
> remote than you pull from, and by default with **push.default=simple**
> the upstream branch you configure must have the same name.

> ·
>
> Various commands, including **git** **checkout** and **git**
> **status**, will show you how many commits have been added to your
> current branch and the upstream since you forked from it, for example
> "Your branch and *origin/main* have diverged, and have 2 and 3
> different commits each respectively".

The upstream is stored in **.git/config**, in the "**remote**" and
"**merge**" fields. For example, if **main**s upstream is
**origin/main**:

> [branch "main"]
>        remote = origin
>        merge = refs/heads/main

You can set an upstream branch explicitly with **git** **push**
**--set-upstream** *\<remote\>* *\<branch\>* but Git will often
automatically set the upstream for you, for example:

> ·
>
> When you clone a repository, Git will automatically set the upstream
> for the default branch.

> ·
>
> If you have the **push.autoSetupRemote** configuration option set,
> **git** **push** will automatically set the upstream the first time
> you push a branch.

> ·
>
> Checking out a remote-tracking branch with **git** **checkout**
> *\<branch\>* will automatically create a local branch with that name
> and set the upstream to the remote branch.

> \
>
> **Note**
>
> \
>
> Upstream branches are sometimes referred to as "tracking information",
> as in "set the branch’s tracking information".

## MERGE STRATEGIES

The merge mechanism (**git** **merge** and **git** **pull** commands)
allows the backend *merge strategies* to be chosen with **-s** option.
Some strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by
giving **-X***\<option\>* arguments to **git** **merge** and/or **git**
**pull**.

**ort**

> This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.
> This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
> algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be
> used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors
> and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been
> reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges
> by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
> development history. Additionally this strategy can detect and handle
> merges involving renames. It does not make use of detected copies. The
> name for this algorithm is an acronym ("Ostensibly Recursive’s Twin")
> and came from the fact that it was written as a replacement for the
> previous default algorithm, **recursive**.
>
> In the case where the path is a submodule, if the submodule commit
> used on one side of the merge is a descendant of the submodule commit
> used on the other side of the merge, Git attempts to fast-forward to
> the descendant. Otherwise, Git will treat this case as a conflict,
> suggesting as a resolution a submodule commit that is descendant of
> the conflicting ones, if one exists.
>
> The **ort** strategy can take the following options:
>
> **ours**
>
> > This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
> > favoring *our* version. Changes from the other tree that do not
> > conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a
> > binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
> >
> > This should not be confused with the **ours** merge strategy, which
> > does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It
> > discards everything the other tree did, declaring *our* history
> > contains all that happened in it.
>
> **theirs**
>
> > This is the opposite of **ours**; note that, unlike **ours**, there
> > is no **theirs** merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.
>
> **ignore-space-change**, **ignore-all-space**,
> **ignore-space-at-eol**, **ignore-cr-at-eol**
>
> > Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
> > unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes
> > mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored. See also
> > **git-diff**(1) **-b**, **-w**, **--ignore-space-at-eol**, and
> > **--ignore-cr-at-eol**.
> >
> > > ·
> > >
> > > If *their* version only introduces whitespace changes to a line,
> > > *our* version is used;
> >
> > > ·
> > >
> > > If *our* version introduces whitespace changes but *their* version
> > > includes a substantial change, *their* version is used;
> >
> > > ·
> > >
> > > Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.
>
> **renormalize**
>
> > This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of

> > details.
>
> **no-renormalize**
>
> > Disables the **renormalize** option. This overrides the
> > **merge.renormalize** configuration variable.
>
> **find-renames**\[**=***\<n\>*\]

**recursive**

With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
**ort**), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on
one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result;
some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the
heads and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the
individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted
change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.

## DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR

Often people use **git** **pull** without giving any parameter.
Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying **git** **pull**
**origin**. However, when configuration **branch.***\<name\>***.remote**
is present while on branch *\<name\>*, that value is used instead of
**origin**.

In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value of the
configuration **remote.***\<origin\>***.url** is consulted and if there
is not any such variable, the value on the **URL:** line in
**\$GIT_DIR/remotes/***\<origin\>* is used.

In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and optionally
store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is run without
any refspec parameters on the command line, values of the configuration
variable **remote.***\<origin\>***.fetch** are consulted, and if there
aren’t any, **\$GIT_DIR/remotes/***\<origin\>* is consulted and its
**Pull:** lines are used. In addition to the refspec formats described
in the OPTIONS section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks like
this:

> refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store what were
fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with
**/\***. The above specifies that all remote branches are tracked using
remote-tracking branches in **refs/remotes/origin/** hierarchy under the
same name.

The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after fetching is a
bit involved, in order not to break backward compatibility.

If explicit refspecs were given on the command line of **git** **pull**,
they are all merged.

When no refspec was given on the command line, then **git** **pull**
uses the refspec from the configuration or
**\$GIT_DIR/remotes/***\<origin\>*. In such cases, the following rules
apply:

> 1\.
>
> If **branch.***\<name\>***.merge** configuration for the current
> branch *\<name\>* exists, that is the name of the branch at the remote
> site that is merged.

> 2\.
>
> If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged.

> 3\.
>
> Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged.

## EXAMPLES

> ·
>
> Update the remote-tracking branches for the repository you cloned
> from, then merge one of them into your current branch:
>
> > $ git pull
> >     $ git pull origin
>
> Normally the branch merged in is the **HEAD** of the remote
> repository, but the choice is determined by the
> **branch.***\<name\>***.remote** and **branch.***\<name\>***.merge**
> options; see **git-config**(1) for details.

> ·
>
> Merge into the current branch the remote branch **next**:
>
> > $ git pull origin next
>
> This leaves a copy of **next** temporarily in **FETCH_HEAD**, and
> updates the remote-tracking branch **origin/next**. The same can be
> done by invoking fetch and merge:
>
> > $ git fetch origin
> >     $ git merge origin/next

If you tried a pull which resulted in complex conflicts and would want
to start over, you can recover with **git** **reset**.

## SECURITY

The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a
malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository.
This applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a
server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant
read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read
access to the entire repository.

The known attack vectors are as follows:

> 1\.
>
> The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has
> that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to
> optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses
> an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to
> send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
> victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X
> back to the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a
> client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace
> the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for
> a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a public
> branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and
> pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

> 2\.
>
> As in \#1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim
> sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker
> falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta
> against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
> attacker.

## BUGS

Using **--recurse-submodules** can only fetch new commits in already
checked out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new
submodule in the just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule
itself cannot be fetched, making it impossible to check out that
submodule later without having to do a fetch again. This is expected to
be fixed in a future Git version.
